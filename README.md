This verb conjugator handles most predicates in Korean. To have it work, source the backend, enter a Korean predicate (ending in '다'), then hit enter. Then, it will return your verbs in past, present, and future,
and in informal impolite, informal polite, and formal polite registers.
The conjugator does have a few limitations:
1. It does not conjugate copula predicates ('이다') that end in a vowel, since the '이' disappears, and the non-verb predicate just ends in '다.' This conjugator will treat these as if they were verbs that end with
that vowel.
2. It only handles exceptions that follow a rule. If an exception breaks a rule and requires memorization, the conjugator cannot handle that yet.
I don't believe there are any other exceptions.
Thank you!!
